# Contrapunctus

An illustrated atlas of Western art music, from Bach to the present: composer portraits with technical listening notes, playable score examples, the origins of the forms, and the paintings and poems that share their world.

**Site:** https://mottopanikeiku.github.io/contrapunctus/

## Structure

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `content/composers/*.mjs` | One file per composer (life, sound, works, score examples in ABC, sister arts, recordings, lineage) |
| `content/eras/*.mjs` | The seven chapters |
| `content/pages/*.mjs` | Long-form pages: Origins, Workshop |
| `content/site.mjs` | Home page copy, hero slides, timeline events |
| `src/build.mjs` | Static generator (no dependencies) → `docs/` |
| `tools/art.mjs` | Wikimedia Commons search / check / fetch (images re-encoded to WebP) |
| `tools/validate.mjs` | Schema, links, ABC notation and image checks for content files |

## Build

```sh
node tools/art.mjs fetch     # download any newly referenced Commons images (needs ffmpeg)
node src/build.mjs           # write docs/
python3 -m http.server -d docs 8080
```

GitHub Pages serves `docs/` from `main`.
